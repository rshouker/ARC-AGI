# Tasks for color text and keybindings

[x] for "Show symbol numbers": if the color is dark (rgb average < 128), use white text, else use black text
[x] if the text size doesn't fit in the cell, use smaller text that would fit.
[x] where the colors are picked from, write the symbol numbers as before, but keep it always on, even if the "Show symbol numbers" is off
[x] add keybindings for picking the symbols, the same as the symbol (number) key.
